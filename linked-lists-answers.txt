Exercises
1. A benefit to using a linked list versus an array is that the elements can be
saved and accessed in memory as you need them instead of requiring a set
amount of memory like an array element. This also allows us to grow our linked
lists enormously. A con is that it can get difficult to search for a single node
because we would have to search through all nodes to find the specific one,
whereas arrays can be searched by the specific index where they're located.

2. Users on social media sites like facebook could be organized as a linked list
because of the way they are able to recommend friends based on mutual
connections. Your user profile could be the head of the node and as you link
with another friend, your network of possible friend suggestions could grow
larger and larger.
