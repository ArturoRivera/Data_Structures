//Array input
var lineForRide = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

//Inserting new person to the line
lineForRide.push("Mary");
console.log(lineForRide);

function searchForRider(name) {
    for(i = 0; i < lineForRide.length; i++) {
       if(name === lineForRide[i]){
           console.log(i);
           return true

       } else if (name != lineForRide[i]) {
           console.log("This rider is not in line.");
           return false;
       }
    }
}

//Searching for someone in line
searchForRider("Vivian")

//Adding new person in line to specific index
lineForRide.splice(1, 0, "Melissa");
console.log(lineForRide);

//Removing someone from line
lineForRide.splice(3, 1);
console.log(lineForRide);

2. Car production is another real-world example that you can model using a data
structure. Car factories will often have an assembly line that resembles an
array where cars may have to be added in order or at random locations depending
on the exact configurations of the builds. Cars can be added to the front of
the assembly line or inserted in a specific index if the car needs to be
completed sooner.

3. Developers would have access to the data so that they can make necessary
adjustments when new models of cars are introduced into the manufacturing
facility and the programs need to be updated to account for the new cars.
They would also be able to keep track of the pace which cars are being
manufactured to find inefficiencies. Developers could also search for specific
models if there was a recall on manufacturing and some cars had to be removed
or updated.
